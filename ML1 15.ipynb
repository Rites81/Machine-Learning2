    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a critical concept in machine learning that refers to the tradeoff between the model's ability to fit the training data (low bias) and its ability to generalize to new and unseen data (low variance). In simpler terms, bias represents the prediction error of a model that is caused by assumptions made about the training dataset, while variance refers to the error caused by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a model with low bias tends to have high variance, meaning it overfits the data and performs poorly on new data. On the other hand, a model with low variance tends to have high bias, meaning it underfits the data and fails to capture the true underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test datasets.\n",

    " \n",
    "Regularization is a technique in machine learning that helps to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function of a model. This penalty term helps to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients in a model, leading to a more general model that is less likely to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This results in a sparse model where many of the coefficients are zero. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the squared magnitude of the coefficients. This results in a model where all of the coefficients are small but non-zero.\n",

    "Another technique used for regularization is dropout regularization. Here, a percentage of randomly selected neurons are dropped out during training in order to prevent the model from relying too much on any single neuron.\n",
